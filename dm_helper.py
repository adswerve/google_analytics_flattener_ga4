        Keys allowed for built-in environment variables related to deployment using deployment manager

        deployment:	The name of the deployment.
        name:	The name declared in the configuration that is using the template. This can be useful if you want the
                name you declare in the configuration to be the name of the resource in the underlying templates.
        project: The project ID for this deployment.
        project_number: The project number for this deployment.
        current_time:   The UTC timestamp when expansion started for the deployment.
        type:	The resource type declared in the top-level configuration.
        username:	The current Deployment Manager user.

        For example:
        >>gcloud config list
        [core]
        account = first.last@domain.com
        disable_usage_reporting = False
        project = some-project
        [gcloudignore]
        enabled = true
        Your active configuration is: [default]

        >>gcloud deployment-manager deployments create deploy-cmdline-name --config dm.yaml

        would result in:

        "deployment": "deploy-cmdline-name"
        "project": "some-project"
        "current_time": 1592015636
        "project_number": "423452468050"
        "username": "first.last@domain.com"
        NOTE:  Dependent on which template calls generate_config()
        "name": "function"
        "type": "dmt_cloud_function.py"
